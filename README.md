## Summary
This analysis has demonstrated that demographics play a large role in the success of bike-sharing programs. As the data shows, subscribers are much more likely to be male and ride CitiBikes for their morning and evening weekday commutes. Customers are much more likely to be gender neutral and ride CitiBikes on the weekends. When preparing a business proposal and determining ideal locations to set up start & end stations, it is important to consider the city's gender demographics and assess whether certain districts are more business-oriented or more tourism-oriented. In addition, it would be helpful to visualize ridership metrics based on the rider's birth year. This data can then be considered along with the gender demographics of the city when determining start & end station locations. Furthermore, it would be helpful to look at the population density of each district to match the potential demand for start & end stations.
