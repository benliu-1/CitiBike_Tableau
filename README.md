# Module 9 | Assignment - CitiBike with Tableau
## Overview of Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize New York City's CitiBike data using Tableau in order to formulate a business proposal to investors who are interested in starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

## Results

    Almost all bike trip durations are under an hour, with the majority of trips lasting only 5 minutes. Since bike trips are generally short, it means that riders usually have a specific destination in mind and are riding to that destination, rather than using the ride for sight-seeing.

    Although there are almost 4 times as many male riders as there are female riders, the most common trip duration is the same between both genders.

    During the workweek, as is somewhat expected, ridership is most high during the morning and evening commute hours, with a particularly noticeable spike on Thursday evenings. During the weekends, ridership volume is much more consistent among all hours of the day.

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](/Trips_by_Gender_Weekday_per_Hour.png)
    Ridership among both genders spike at similar hours of the day as well as days of the week. Riders with unknown genders are likely visiting tourists, since they are not subscribers. As expected, unknown gender riders see the most ridership during the weekends.

    Proportionately, there are much more male riders than female riders in the subscriber group than in the customer group. Subscribers are much more likely to commuters than visiting tourists. Thus, this means that commuters that use CitiBike are much more likely to be male, but visiting tourists are only slightly more likely to be male rather than female.

## Summary
This analysis has demonstrated that demographics play a large role in the success of bike-sharing programs. As the data shows, subscribers are much more likely to be male and ride CitiBikes for their morning and evening weekday commutes. Customers are much more likely to be gender neutral and ride CitiBikes on the weekends. When preparing a business proposal and determining ideal locations to set up start & end stations, it is important to consider the city's gender demographics and assess whether certain districts are more business-oriented or more tourism-oriented. In addition, it would be helpful to visualize ridership metrics based on the rider's birth year. This data can then be considered along with the gender demographics of the city when determining start & end station locations. Furthermore, it would be helpful to look at the population density of each district to match the potential demand for start & end stations.
